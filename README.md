# Monopole Antenna Measurement Report

## Background

A monopole antenna is a widely used basic antenna configuration that employs a single conductive element, typically a vertical rod or wire.
It uses the principle of image theory, where the ground plane acts as a virtual mirror, improving its radiation efficiency.

Monopole antennas are essential in wireless communications, radar systems, and electromagnetic devices. Understanding their performance through careful measurements helps optimize their design for real-world applications.

## Measurements Conducted

### 1. Return Wave Measurement

Return wave measurement characterizes the time-varying electromagnetic fields radiated by the monopole antenna, providing insight into frequency, amplitude, and phase behavior.

### 2. Azimuth Radiation Pattern Measurement

This measurement quantifies the spatial distribution of radiation emitted by the monopole antenna across azimuthal angles, revealing directional characteristics such as beamwidth and directivity.

### Summary

The monopole antenna showed stable and reliable performance across the frequency range of 200 MHz to 2200 MHz.
Return wave measurements maintained consistent strength, and the radiation pattern displayed a typical directional profile with an average strength of 32 dB.
The radiation pattern analysis confirmed that the antenna is highly directional, with most energy radiating along its axis.

These results confirm the monopole antennaâ€™s efficient radiation characteristics and suitability for applications requiring wideband coverage and directional transmission such as radar and communication systems.
